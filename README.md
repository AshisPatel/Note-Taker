  <h2>End Note - A Thank You to the Reader</h2>

  Thank you for checking out my project and README! With this project, I have taken my first steps into creating a full-stack project, so to that we have a mini-celebratory moment! ðŸ¥³ With that said, working with express.js was neat! There's some weird stuff going on with how certain variables over-write in terms of getting responses, however thanks to this I got to do a lot of delving into the syntax and learned a lot. The routing system is really nice, and APIs have been slightly demystified. On next week's episode of Ashis becomes a developer, we get to tackle databases! Then, we can have a website, where we don't all have the same notes. I believe I cleared out all my embarrassing  random notes from the website, so if you see anything there _it wasn't me_. 

  **Fun Fact**: The placement of candles on birthday cakes has various potential origins. Ancient Egyptians used candles during coronations, which were held to raise the status of humans to gods. Later, ancient Greeks placed candles on moon-shaped honey cakes made for the goddess Artemis. The Greeks thought that the smoke from blown-out candles lifted prayers and wishes to the tops of Mount Olympus. Another hypothesis as to the origin of birthday candles is rooted in the German practice of placing a candle in the center of bread or cake baked into the likeness of baby Jesus, which symbolized the light of life.
